Hello there, my name is Muhammad Farhan Pulungan. I have had a big interest in computers since I was a child, and I am currently studying some programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and others. I have learned about these programming languages from various sources like MDN, The Odin Project, Dicoding, and Code Bro.

I am an enthusiastic individual and enjoy learning new things.
